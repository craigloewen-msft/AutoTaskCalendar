# Google Analytics Configuration
# Option 1 (Recommended): Set at runtime on the server
# - In production: Set GA_MEASUREMENT_ID as an environment variable on Azure Web App
# - In development: Add 'devGaMeasurementId' to config.js
#
# Option 2: Set at build time (legacy approach, requires rebuild to change)
# - Copy this file to .env.local and replace with your actual Google Analytics Measurement ID
# - Get your measurement ID from https://analytics.google.com (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
